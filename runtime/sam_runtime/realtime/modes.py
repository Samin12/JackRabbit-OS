    "installed Skill, remain in Primary Voice and use load_agent_skill when its disclosure is "

    "delegate a goal. If delegation intent is materially ambiguous, ask one concise "
    "clarifying question before switching. Background completion envelopes are host-delivered "

    "stop condition, or authority. Keep verificationMethod, completionConditions, and stopConditions "
    "explicit and separate. Completion conditions are successful observable end states. Stop conditions "
    "are exceptional blockers that end work without success, such as unavailable required access; never "
    "repeat a completion condition as a stop condition. Runtime limits are safety stops, never proof of success. Never ask the "
    "user to choose internal tools or implementation details. Before submission, briefly "
    "recap the interpreted goal. Pass the user's original delegation request verbatim as "
    "originalRequest and keep your normalized actionable statement in objective. When sufficient, "
    "call goal_start once. A successful goal_start "

    "the actual failure. If the user cancels or asks to leave without submitting, call "
