# SamRabbit Mac bridge (Heptabase journal)

The R1 writes your words and activity lines into your Heptabase journal. This
bridge lets it do that through the Heptabase desktop app on your Mac, using the
app's own CLI (`heptabase journal append` / `journal read`). There is no
Heptabase sign-in and nothing to click in Heptabase.

```
R1 runtime ──HTTP (LAN, bearer token)──▶ samrabbit_bridge.py on the Mac ──▶ heptabase CLI ──▶ Heptabase app
```

## Requirements

- The Heptabase desktop app is running, with its CLI turned on
  (Heptabase > Settings > AI Features). `heptabase --version` should print `0.7.x`.
- macOS system Python 3.9+ (`/usr/bin/python3`). The bridge uses only the standard library.
- The R1 and the Mac are on the same local network.

## Install

```sh
companion/mac-bridge/install.sh            # options: --port 3780 --host 0.0.0.0 --python /usr/bin/python3
```

You can run it again at any time. It:

1. creates `~/.config/samrabbit/bridge-token` (random, mode 0600) if it doesn't exist yet, and never prints it;
2. copies the bridge to `~/Library/Application Support/SamRabbit/bridge/`;
3. writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.samrabbit.bridge.plist` (RunAtLoad, KeepAlive, a PATH that includes
   `/opt/homebrew/bin`, and logs to `~/Library/Logs/samrabbit-bridge.log`);
4. reloads the agent (`launchctl bootout`/`bootstrap`/`kickstart`), waits for `/health`, and prints the bridge URL.

Then point the R1 at the bridge. You can do this from the R1's management page (Connections > Heptabase journal >
"Connect through your Mac", then paste the URL and token), or with the Mac helper
`~/jr-toolchain/heptabase-bridge-connect.sh`, which installs the bridge and configures the R1 over a paired
management session.

`uninstall.sh` stops and removes the agent and keeps the token. `uninstall.sh --purge` also deletes the token.

## HTTP API

Every route needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and the token is compared in constant time. Only loopback and
private-LAN peers are accepted (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, 169.254/16, fc00::/7, fe80::/10).

| Route | Result |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | `{ok, service, version, cli:{available, version}, app:{reachable, detail}, checkedAt}` (cached 10 s) |
| `POST /v1/heptabase/journal/append` `{date:"YYYY-MM-DD", content:"<markdown>"}` | the CLI's `{date, title, contentMd5}` |
| `GET /v1/heptabase/journal/read?date=YYYY-MM-DD` | `{date, title, text, contentMd5}`: the day as plain text lines (paragraphs, headings, `- ` bullets, `1. ` numbers, `[ ]`/`[x]` todos, `+ ` toggles, `> ` quotes; marks removed; nested items indented) |

- `content` is Markdown as the desktop CLI parses it: CommonMark plus Heptabase's list (`+` toggles, `- [ ]` todos)
  and `{{...}}` mention syntax. Hepta Markdown tags such as `<hepta-color>` are **not** parsed and would show as
  literal text, so the R1 sends its gray action lines as italics on this path.
- The body may be at most 64 KB. `content` is written to a private 0600 temp file, passed with
  `--content-file`, and deleted right after.
- Appends run one at a time. Each CLI call has a 30 s limit.
- Errors look like `{"error":{"code","message","retryable","written"[,"reason"]}}`. `written` is `false` when the
  journal definitely wasn't changed and `"unknown"` when it might have been, for example after a CLI timeout. The
  R1's outbox retries `false` errors with backoff. For `"unknown"` it first reads the day back and looks for the
  entry, and resends only if it's missing.

| Status | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 401 | `unauthorized` | missing or wrong token |
| 400 / 411 / 413 | `invalid_date`, `invalid_content`, `invalid_json`, `length_required`, `body_too_large` | bad request |
| 422 | `heptabase_rejected` (+ `reason`) | the app refused the content |
| 503 | `heptabase_app_unavailable` | the Heptabase app is closed or its CLI is off (retry later) |
| 503 | `heptabase_cli_missing`, `heptabase_busy`, `heptabase_app_error`, `bridge_busy` | retry later |
| 504 | `heptabase_cli_timeout` | the CLI didn't answer in 30 s (`written: "unknown"`) |

## Privacy

- The log has one line per request: method, route, status, duration, and an error code if there is one. It never
  contains journal text, query strings, CLI output or the token.
- Error replies never repeat the CLI's own messages, because they could quote journal content.
- The token file is re-read when it changes. To rotate it, delete the file, run `install.sh`, and connect the R1
  again.

## Tests

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s companion/mac-bridge/tests
```

The tests put a fake `heptabase` executable first on `PATH` (`tests/fake_heptabase.py`) and run the installer
against a throwaway home with `SAMRABBIT_SKIP_LAUNCHCTL=1`.

## Troubleshooting

- `app: reachable false, detail heptabase_app_unavailable`: open Heptabase, or run `heptabase start`, and check that
  CLI is enabled in Settings > AI Features. Entries wait on the R1 and go out once the app is back.
- Nothing answers on port 3780: run `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.samrabbit.bridge` and
  `tail ~/Library/Logs/samrabbit-bridge.log`.
- The Mac's IP changed: run `heptabase-bridge-connect.sh` again, or update the URL on the R1's management page.
