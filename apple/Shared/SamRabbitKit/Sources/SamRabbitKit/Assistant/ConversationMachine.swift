/// The watch's always-on conversation with SamRabbit, as a pure state machine: the watch app feeds it what
/// happened (the microphone heard speech, a turn's stream said something, playback ran dry, a tap) and carries
/// out the effects it returns (open the microphone, send a turn, play, speak, cancel, end). No audio, network or
/// clock of its own, so every rule below is unit-tested.
///
///     idle -> starting -> listening -> hearing -> thinking -> speaking -> listening -> ...
///
/// * A conversation starts from the app's launch, the Action Button, Siri, a complication or a tap on the orb;
///   the Mac is warmed up at once (`warmUp`).
/// * Half duplex: the microphone is closed while a turn is on its way and while anything plays (no echo), and
///   reopened after (auto-continue).
/// * Barge-in: a tap while thinking or speaking cancels the turn on the Mac (`cancel`), stops playback and listens.
/// * A reply without audio is spoken by the watch itself (`speak`); a Mac that can't be reached is said out loud
///   ("I can't reach your Mac right now"), then the conversation ends. A warm-up that fails before the audio runs
///   (the microphone prompt, Siri still holding it) is said once it does (`audioReady`).
/// * Announcements (T3 tasks that finished or need Samin) wait until the conversation is listening, then play:
///   their own clip if they have one (the words, said by the watch, when the clip can't be read), else as a
///   `{"announce": id}` turn in the conversation's voice. The bridge counts one as told once the watch has it, so
///   none is ever dropped: one that waits when the conversation ends is said when the next one starts.
/// * It ends on Stop, when the Mac says so (`endConversation`), after `idleTimeout` (about 2 minutes) without a
///   turn that heard words (noise, coughs and empty transcripts don't count), or after the current reply when the
///   app leaves the screen (coming back while it plays keeps the conversation going).
