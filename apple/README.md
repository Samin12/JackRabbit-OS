# SamRabbit for iPhone and Apple Watch

Native apps that control SamRabbit (the R1's voice orchestrator, T3 Code tasks, the calendar, the Heptabase
journal, the Mac, generated UIs and the R1's conversations) through one hub: the Mac bridge's mobile API
(`/v1/mobile/*`, see `CONTRACTS-WAVE4`). Phone, widgets and watch talk only to the bridge, with a
per-device bearer token, over the local network (or Tailscale).

## Quick start (simulator, no Apple ID needed)

```sh
apple/generate.sh                                   # needs XcodeGen 2.46+ (brew install xcodegen)
/usr/bin/python3 -I apple/dev/fake_bridge.py        # fake bridge on 127.0.0.1:3799, pairing code SAMRABBT
apple/dev/run-sim.sh                                # build + install + launch on the booted iPhone simulator
xcrun simctl openurl booted 'samrabbit://pair?h=127.0.0.1:3799&c=SAMRABBT&n=Fake%20Mac'
```

Or in the app: Settings > Enter code manually, address `127.0.0.1:3799`, code `SAMR-ABBT`.

The Apple Watch pairs itself through the iPhone (no code on the watch):

```sh
xcrun simctl pair <watch-udid> <iphone-udid>        # once; e.g. Apple Watch Series 12 (46mm) with iPhone 18 Pro
apple/dev/run-watch.sh                              # build + install + launch on that watch
apple/dev/run-watch.sh -- -SamRabbitPage needs      # open on a page (status, needs, working, upnext, quick)
```

Installing the iPhone app also carries the watch app (`SamRabbit.app/Watch/`); on a real iPhone the Watch app
installs it. On the simulator `run-watch.sh` installs it directly.

The fake bridge never touches T3, Google Calendar, Heptabase, the R1 or the live bridge on :3780. It invents
everything in memory (only pairings persist, in `apple/dev/.state/`). Approving, answering and replying move
threads along on their own; new tasks run about 45 s (so the Live Activity has something to show); the live R1
conversation gets a streamed exchange every minute (`--no-chatter` turns that off). Loopback helpers:
`POST /__fake/reset`, `POST /__fake/settle` (finish every pending step), `POST /__fake/chatter`,
`GET /__fake/journal`, `POST /__fake/rerequest {threadId, text?}` (the open approval or question was answered
elsewhere and T3 asks a new one: same thread, new `requestId`) and `POST /__fake/t3 {available}` (T3 Code stops
answering: the summary says `t3.available=false`, every `/v1/mobile/t3/*` route answers 503 `t3_unavailable`) and
`POST /__fake/transcribe {mode?, text?, delay?}` / `GET /__fake/transcribe` (what the watch's voice route answers:
`ok` with the canned `text`, `empty`, `unavailable`, `permission`, `failed`, `busy`, `no_speech` or `missing`, an
older bridge without the route; GET lists the recordings that arrived: size, type, lang, device).
`POST /v1/mobile/transcribe` checks a recording like the real bridge (Content-Type, Content-Length, 2 MiB, the
container's own bytes, the m4a's length) and the summary carries `transcribe: {available, reason?}`.
The watch's assistant (CONTRACTS-WAVE5, the streaming turn protocol) is there too, with canned answers:
`POST /v1/mobile/assistant/turn` (a 16 kHz WAV utterance or `{text|announce}`; with `Accept:
application/x-samrabbit-stream` a chunked stream of `J` JSON events and `A` PCM16 16 kHz frames of a made-up voice,
else the buffered JSON answer), `/assistant/session`, `/assistant/cancel` (the stream ends with
`done{interrupted:true}`), `/assistant/end`, `GET /assistant/announcements`, and `assistant: {available, brain,
model, chatgpt}` in the summary. `POST /__fake/assistant {mode?, say?, heard?, delay?, pace?, brain?, clear?, code?,
hold?, ping?, busyFor?}` / `GET /__fake/assistant` (what arrived: turns, sessions, cancels, ends, turns refused 409)
and `POST /__fake/announce {say?, kind?, audio?}` (`audio: "broken"`: a clip no player can read); `hold` keeps the
stream quiet after `heard` (a long tool call) with a `{"type":"ping"}` every `ping` seconds, `busyFor` refuses turns
409 for that long from the first one, `code` is the `error` mode's code (then `done`, like the real bridge); modes
`ok`, `noaudio`, `noise`, `end`, `error`, `slow`, `busy`, `unavailable`, `drop` (no answer at all),
`buffered`, `buffered_clip` (an AAC clip, like the Claude fallback's MP3) and `missing` (an older bridge).
Pending approvals and questions carry `requestId` (questions also `questionId`) and `respond` refuses a stale id
with 409 `t3_request_not_pending`, exactly like the real bridge.

## Tests

```sh
cd apple/Shared/SamRabbitKit && swift test          # 180 tests on macOS, including the client against the fake bridge
# the same suite (minus the fake-bridge tests) on the watch simulator, and compiled for the watch's hardware:
(cd apple/Shared/SamRabbitKit && xcodebuild -scheme SamRabbitKit -destination 'platform=watchOS Simulator,name=Apple Watch Series 12 (46mm)' test)
(cd apple/Shared/SamRabbitKit && xcodebuild -scheme SamRabbitKit -destination generic/platform=watchOS \
  build-for-testing CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=YES)
xcodebuild -project apple/SamRabbit.xcodeproj -scheme SamRabbitWatch -destination generic/platform=watchOS \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO SWIFT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=YES build   # arm64 and arm64_32 slices
xcodebuild -project apple/SamRabbit.xcodeproj -scheme SamRabbit \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 18 Pro' test   # the same suite minus the fake-bridge tests, on iOS
curl -X POST 127.0.0.1:3799/__fake/reset             # then the watch walkthrough (real taps, screenshots attached):
xcodebuild -project apple/SamRabbit.xcodeproj -scheme SamRabbitWatch \
  -destination 'platform=watchOS Simulator,name=Apple Watch Series 12 (46mm)' test
# just the voice input: -only-testing:SamRabbitWatchUITests/WatchVoiceTests
# the conversation:    -only-testing:SamRabbitWatchUITests/WatchConversationTests
```

**32-bit watch hardware.** The watch's arm64_32 slice has a 32-bit `Int`, while every simulator is 64-bit: epoch
milliseconds (`at`, `lastAt`, `nextBefore`, ...), cursors, sequence numbers and millisecond durations are `Int64` in
SamRabbitKit, JSON numbers become integers only through `JSONNumbers` / `JSONValue.int64` (never `Int(Double)`, which
traps), and frame and WAV lengths are read as `UInt32`. `Watch32BitTests` decodes payloads with real millisecond
values and checks with `Int32Range.violations(in:)` that no `Int` in the decoded models holds a value a 32-bit `Int`
can't; building the tests for `generic/platform=watchOS` also compiles them for arm64_32 (a 64-bit literal in an
`Int` fails there).

The fake-bridge tests start `fake_bridge.py` on a free port per test (macOS only: the iOS simulator cannot spawn
processes). They cover pairing (a wrong or expired code, the rate limit, host failover and promotion), unpairing
(the Mac revokes the phone and its watch), re-provisioning the watch (the old child token stops working), one
reused client per pairing, the summary, threads
(approve/answer/reply/stop/create, a stale card refused with 409, T3 down while the summary works), conversations
and events into the timeline, SSE, blobs, generated UIs,
calendar, the journal, the Mac, child (watch) tokens and the shared actions/notification planning. The relay tests
run the watch's `BridgeClient` against a closed port, a port that never answers and the fake bridge, with the iPhone's
half of the relay in process (`BridgeAccount.performRelayed`): reads and unsent writes go through the phone with the
watch's own token (a revoked watch gets 401 through the phone too), pairing/unpairing/device routes are never relayed,
a write that may have reached the Mac (a POST that timed out) is never sent twice, and the bridge's error envelope
survives the relay. Unit tests cover the links (every link that writes needs confirmation), the notification keys
and the widget reload rule (compared as encoded bytes, so sub-millisecond dates don't reload every time), and
re-pairing (the same Mac retires the old device; a wrong code keeps the old pairing; another Mac is left alone).
Voice (`VoiceTests`, `VoiceBridgeTests`): chunking and the phone's reassembly (any order, repeats, mismatched or
oversized pieces, stalled recordings), the upload as the bridge sees it (`audio/mp4`, the file's exact bytes,
`?lang=`, the device's token), the recording format (AVFoundation encodes `VoiceFormat.recorderSettings`), every
error code to its friendly words, when a recording ends (`VoiceActivity`), and the iPhone relay (chunks, the watch's
own token, a revoked watch refused, a Mac that times out tried through the phone).

The watch walkthrough (`watchOS/UITests/WatchWalkthroughTests.swift`, needs the fake bridge and the paired simulators)
opens every page, approves, answers a question, taps Approve on a card whose request was replaced on the Mac
(refused: "Request changed", the new request shows), opens a task, blocks 30 minutes, says a journal note and a new
task (voice, see below), runs a request through the iPhone (`-SamRabbitRoute phone`) and, after the watch's token is
revoked on the bridge, reconnects through the iPhone (these run with `-SamRabbitConversation off`).
`WatchVoiceTests` drives the voice capture:
listening, transcribing, review and Send for a new task, Reply, Answer and a journal note; Stop and Say again; voice
unavailable (from the summary and from the Mac), a failed transcription and no speech; through the iPhone in chunks;
the microphone refused; and checks that no keyboard or text field ever appears. `WatchFaceTests` (opt-in, `TEST_RUNNER_SAMRABBIT_FACES=setup`)
adds Infograph, Modular and Activity Digital faces with the SamRabbit complications and screenshots them.
`WatchConversationTests` drives the conversation with the made-up voice: it opens listening, hears, streams the reply
(caption, the task it started) and listens again; tap to interrupt (the Mac is told to cancel); a reply without audio
spoken by the watch; a Mac that can't be reached (said, then the end); an announcement between turns; the end after a
quiet while and by the Mac; the buffered fallback with a clip; the Action Button's intent opening the conversation;
the whole turn through the iPhone with the watch's own token; Stop; Stop while the audio is still starting (the
microphone stays off, and Stop then Talk inside that window runs one start); a warm-up refused while the audio starts
(said once it runs, then the problem); a 45 s tool call with no keep-alive waited for; the Digital Crown during a reply
and straight back (it goes on listening); a fatal `error` event mid-stream (said, then the end); a 0.22 s "yes"
(`-SamRabbitFixtureLength 0.22`) sent like any utterance; 409 through the iPhone retried until the Mac answers; an
announcement clip that can't be read, said by the watch. In debug builds the state line's accessibility value says `audio on`/`audio off`
(whether the microphone is live) for these checks.

The Action Button tests press the simulator's real Action Button (`XCUIDevice.press(.action)`); both are opt-in:
`ActionButtonUITests` (iPhone, `TEST_RUNNER_SAMRABBIT_ACTION_BUTTON=1`, after setting the simulator's Action Button to
the SamRabbit control) and `WatchActionButtonTests` (Apple Watch Ultra simulator, `=1` sets the watch's Action Button,
`=press` only presses). See "The Action Button" below.

## Installing on your own iPhone and Apple Watch

1. Xcode > Settings > Accounts: add your Apple ID.
2. Create `apple/Config/Signing.local.xcconfig` (git-ignored):
   ```
   DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = ABCDE12345
   CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Automatic
   CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = Apple Development
   ```
3. `apple/generate.sh --open`, pick your iPhone, Run. Automatic signing registers the App Group
   `group.com.samrabbit.mobile` and the keychain group for every target (the watch app and its complications too).
4. On the Mac: SamRabbit > Pair iPhone… and scan the QR code with the Camera app (or in Settings > Scan).
5. The watch app comes with the iPhone app: install it from the Watch app on the iPhone (My Watch > SamRabbit), or
   run the `SamRabbitWatch` scheme on the watch. It connects through the iPhone by itself; add the complications by
   editing a watch face (SamRabbit > Needs You / Next Up).

## How it is built

**SamRabbitKit** (local Swift package, iOS 26 / watchOS 26 / macOS 26, Swift 6 language mode). Public API:

| Area | Types |
|---|---|
| Models (lenient decoding, ISO-8601 or epoch-ms dates) | `MobileSummary`, `TaskThread`, `ThreadStatus`, `PendingAction`, `ThreadDetail`, `ConversationSummary`, `SyncEvent`, `CalendarEvent`, `Agenda`, `MacState`, `GeneratedArtifact`, `JSONValue`, `MobileSummary.sample()` |
| Client | `BridgeClient` (every mobile route, multi-host failover, `stream(after:)` SSE, `raw(_:)`), `BridgeError`, `LiveSyncFeed` (reconnecting SSE), `ServerSentEventParser` |
| Pairing and links | `PairLink` (`samrabbit://pair?h=&c=&n=`), `AppLink` / `LinkAction` (every `samrabbit://` link; the ones that write become `.confirm`), `BridgeHost`, `PairingCode`, `Pairer` (tries hosts in order), `PairResponse` |
| Storage | `BridgeAccount` (pairing in the App Group, token in the Keychain, one cached `BridgeClient` per pairing, `unpair()` tells the bridge, the watch's child token and `performRelayed`), `KeychainStore`, `SharedContainer`, `SummaryCache` (`publish`: reloads widgets only on change), `TaskTracker` |
| Shared behaviour | `SamRabbitActions` (ask, block, note, open on Mac, approve, answer, refresh + widget reload, spoken "what needs me"), `AlertPlanner` (keyed by thread + request id), `SpokenSummary`, `Formatting` |
| Conversations | `ConversationTimeline` (port of the desktop `store.js`), `TimelineItem`, `GenCard` |
| Look | `SamTheme` (colours, `glassCard()`, `samScreen()`, `StatusChip`, `PulseDot`, `SectionHeader`), `OrbView(mood:)`, `OrbRenderer`, `OrbMood` |
| Watch link | `WatchContext` (applicationContext), `WatchRelay` (sendMessage relay), `BridgeRelay` (the client's second route) |
| Assistant | `ConversationMachine` (the conversation's rules), `SpeechDetector` + `NoiseFloor`, `AssistantStream` / `AssistantStreamParser` (frames), `AssistantEvent`, `AssistantReply` (buffered), `AssistantTurnRequest` / `AssistantTurnResponse`, `BridgeClient.assistantTurn` / `assistantSession` / `assistantCancel` / `assistantEnd` / `assistantAnnouncements`, `TurnRelay` + `TurnRelayHost` (turns through the iPhone), `WAV`, `PCM16`, `AssistantStatus` (`summary.assistant`) |
| Live Activity | `TaskActivityAttributes` (iOS) |

**The orb** is the desktop `OrbRenderer.swift` math, unchanged, evaluated on the CPU: `OrbRenderer.field`
renders only the surface at about one sample per point (soft gradients, bilinear upscaling), and `OrbView`
clips it to a vector circle and draws the halo as a gradient, at 30 fps in a `TimelineView` (paused with Reduce
Motion; `animated: false` for widgets). No Metal shader: it would need the separately downloaded Metal toolchain
on every Mac that builds the app.

**The app**: Home (orb header, quick actions, Needs you with inline Approve/Deny/answers, Working, Up next,
latest conversation), Chats (search, live badges, timeline with cards/images/generated UIs, live over SSE,
generated UIs open interactive in a `WKWebView` with a non-persistent store and a content rule list that only
allows the four CDNs the documents import from: `GeneratedUISandbox`, one rule per scheme and host because WebKit
rejects `|` in `url-filter`; the list is compiled before anything loads and the viewer refuses to open the document
when it does not compile; `SandboxTests` compile it and, on macOS, check in a real web view that a page reaches a
local server without the list and nothing with it), Tasks (sections, Markdown thread detail, approve/deny/answer,
composer with dictation, Stop, New task with a project picker), Mac (state, open app or link, screenshot with
pinch zoom, Generate UI), Settings (QR scan via VisionKit, manual entry, `samrabbit://pair` links, bridge
addresses, notifications, widget gallery, Action Button help). Dictation: the keyboard mic everywhere, plus a mic
button (`SFSpeechRecognizer`, on-device when available, Apple's speech service when the on-device model isn't there;
the speech, audio-tap and result callbacks are nonisolated, since Swift 6 traps a main-actor closure called on
another queue).

**Deep links** (`AppLink`): `samrabbit://pair?…`, `ask[?text=]`, `note[?text=]`, `generate[?text=]`,
`block[?minutes=&title=]`, `mac/open?app=|url=`, `thread/<id>`, `conversation/<id>`,
`tab/<home|chats|tasks|mac|settings>`, `mac/screenshot`. A link can come from any web page or message, so the ones
that write (`block`, and `ask`/`note`/`generate`/`mac/open` with content) never act on their own: they open a
confirmation sheet ("A link wants to Block 45 minutes on your calendar", now until when, Confirm / Cancel, and Edit
first for text). Without content they only open the empty composer. App Intents (Siri, Shortcuts, the widgets'
buttons, the control) still run directly: the person started them.

**Widgets** (`SamRabbitWidgets`): Status (small), Tasks (medium), Up Next (medium, interactive Block 30m),
Dashboard (large, Ask + Block), Needs You (Lock Screen circular + inline), Next Up (Lock Screen rectangular),
the "Ask SamRabbit" control, and the "Task running" Live Activity (Lock Screen + Dynamic Island). The timeline
provider reads the summary the app saved in the App Group and fetches a fresh one itself (8 s budget), every
15 minutes. The app, the background refresh and the actions hand fresh summaries to `SummaryCache.publish`, which
reloads the timelines only when the summary changed (`generatedAt` aside) or the last reload is 30 minutes old.

**App Intents** (Siri and Shortcuts, phrases in `AppShortcuts.swift`): Ask SamRabbit, Ask by Voice ("Talk to
SamRabbit": opens Ask listening), Block Time ("Block 30 minutes with SamRabbit"), Add Journal Note, What Needs Me
(spoken), Open on Mac, Screenshot My Mac. The two that open the app use `supportedModes = .foreground(.immediate)`
(iOS 26's replacement for `openAppWhenRun`).

## The Action Button

Apps can't read the button or assign it; the person picks an action in Settings. SamRabbit offers:

- **iPhone 15 Pro and later**: the "Ask SamRabbit" control (`AskControl`, `OpenAskIntent`), which iOS offers for the
  Action Button as well as Control Center and the Lock Screen, and the "Ask by Voice" App Shortcut (the same intent)
  in the button's Shortcut list. Settings > Action Button > **Controls** > Choose a Control… > SamRabbit > **Ask
  SamRabbit** (or **Shortcut** > Choose a Shortcut… > SamRabbit > **Ask by Voice**). Press and hold: "Hold to Ask
  SamRabbit", then SamRabbit opens at Ask with dictation already listening; say it, tap Start.
- **Apple Watch Ultra (watchOS 26+)**: the watch's own "Ask SamRabbit" control (`WatchAskControl` in the
  complications extension, `OpenSamRabbitWatchIntent` in `watchOS/Intents`, compiled into the watch app and the
  extension). The iPhone's control opens the iPhone app, so watchOS doesn't offer it on the watch. On the watch:
  Settings > Action Button > **Action** (watchOS 27: Choose Action) > **Control**, then **Control** (it says Configure
  until set) > SamRabbit > **Ask SamRabbit**. One press opens SamRabbit straight into a live conversation (pressed
  again while talking: like a tap on the orb, send now or interrupt). Siri on the watch: "Ask SamRabbit", "Talk to
  SamRabbit" (`SamRabbitWatchShortcuts`).

How it works: the intent leaves `samrabbit://ask?listen=1` in the App Group (`PendingRoute`, SamRabbitKit) and posts
`PendingRoute.didChange`. The app takes it when it becomes active, or at once when it is already in front (on the
iPhone pressing the button again starts dictation again; on the watch it acts on the conversation). A route older than two minutes is dropped. Only the
app's own intents may turn the microphone on: `AppLink(url:fromApp:)` keeps `listen` only for them, and a
`samrabbit://ask?listen=1` link from a web page just opens the empty composer. The help is in Settings > Action
Button (iPhone, with "Try it here") and at the bottom of the watch's Quick page.

Checked in the simulators: on the iPhone 18 Pro simulator the control is offered in Settings > Action Button >
Controls and "Ask by Voice" under Shortcut. Pressing the simulator's Action Button (both ways) opens Ask and starts
dictation, cold and while the app is open. The Simulator has no speech recognizer, so dictation then stops with
"Dictation stopped before it heard anything". On the Apple Watch Ultra 4 simulator the control can be set as the
Action Button's control, and pressing the button opens SamRabbit. In that simulator the control picker listed only
the system's own controls, and a watch app freshly installed by `xcodebuild test` isn't registered yet (the press
then fails with "“Ask SamRabbit” failed"). Install with `simctl install` and wait a moment.

**Notifications** (no push): `BGAppRefreshTask` (`com.samrabbit.mobile.refresh`, about every 15 min) and the
foreground refresh (every 20 s) run `AlertPlanner`: a local notification for each new needs-you request and for
tasks started from the phone that finish. Needs-you alerts are keyed by thread id + T3 request id (kept a week in
the App Group), never by the pending text or the list they came from, so the foreground and background agree and a
request is announced once; a thread whose request id is not known yet (summary threads) waits for one.

**Pairing again** while paired with the same Mac (an address in common) retires the old device there: once the
Mac accepted the new code, the old token calls `POST /v1/mobile/unpair` (the old iPhone and its watch go), then the
new token replaces it here. A wrong code keeps the old pairing working; pairing with another Mac only forgets the
first one here.

**Unpair** (Settings) calls `POST /v1/mobile/unpair` first (the Mac revokes this iPhone and the watch it
provisioned; best effort, 6 s), then forgets the pairing, the token and the watch's token here either way. A wrong
or expired pairing code (401 `invalid_code`) says "That code is wrong or expired — get a new one on your Mac", too
many tries (429) says to wait; neither is confused with a token the Mac stopped accepting. The Simulator has no `BGTaskScheduler` ("not available on this
platform"), so the background part only runs on a device; to try it there from the debugger:
`e -l objc -- (void)[[BGTaskScheduler sharedScheduler] _simulateLaunchForTaskWithIdentifier:@"com.samrabbit.mobile.refresh"]`.

## What the app expects where the contract leaves room

Field names follow CONTRACTS-WAVE4 exactly; decoding is lenient everywhere (unknown fields ignored, missing ones
defaulted, alternative names accepted), so these are the shapes `fake_bridge.py` serves:

- Dates: ISO-8601 text (with or without fractional seconds or an offset) or epoch milliseconds.
- `GET /conversations` → `{conversations:[{conversationId,title,startedAt,lastAt,endedAt,live,messageCount,preview,device,cursor}],cursor,nextBefore?}`; events → `{events:[{…,cursor}],cursor,more}`; `/stream` like the desktop stream (`: ready <cursor>`, `id:`/`event: sync`/`data:`).
- `GET /t3/projects` → `{projects:[{projectId|id, name|title}]}`. `POST /t3/threads` → `{threadId,title,projectName}`. Message/respond/stop → any 2xx.
- `pending` → `{kind:"approval"|"question", requestId, questionId?, text, options?}`. Approve / Deny / Answer send `{decision, requestId}` / `{answer, requestId}` for the request the card shows; 409 `t3_request_not_pending` means it changed: the app and the watch say "That request changed, check it again" and refresh. A card without a `requestId` (summary threads carry no pending details) only opens the thread.
- The summary and the thread list are fetched side by side and fail on their own: while T3 Code is not running (`/t3/threads` 503 `t3_unavailable`, `t3_app_missing`, …) Home, the orb, the calendar and the widgets stay fresh and only Needs you / Tasks (and the watch's task pages) say "T3 not connected", over the last list.
- `pending.options` for questions: strings or `{value|decision, label}` objects.
- `GET /calendar/agenda` → `{events:[{eventId?,title,startsAt,endsAt,allDay,location,meetingUrl}]}`; block/events → `{event:{…}}` (an optional `dryRun:true` is shown as "test copy").
- `POST /journal` → `{recorded,state:"sent"|"queued",date}`.
- `GET /mac/state` → the `/v1/mac/state` shape plus `name`/`online` (`computer`, `front:{app,window}`, `visible:[{app,windows}]`, `running`, `screenLocked`, `screenVision`).
- `POST /ui/generate` → `{artifactId}`; artifact status as `/v1/ui/artifacts/<id>`; `/document` is served as HTML.
- `POST /devices/child` → `{token,deviceId,…}` like `pair`.
- Errors: `{error:{code,message,retryable}}`; 401 means "pair again".

## The Apple Watch app

**Pages** (Digital Crown or swipe, a vertically paged `TabView`):

1. **SamRabbit** (the main screen, `AssistantPage`): a live conversation with the assistant, like talking to the R1
   (below). The orb listens, thinks and speaks; one line of status above it ("2 need you · 1 working", or the next
   event); a live caption of what was heard and what is being said, cards and the actions it took; the last turns
   further down. Tap the orb to talk, to send now, or to interrupt; the top-left button stops.
2. **Needs you**: a card per waiting task with **Approve** / **Deny** for approvals, the offered answers as buttons for
   questions, and **Reply** / **Answer** by voice. Tap a card for the task.
3. **Working**: running tasks; a task shows its latest messages with Reply / Answer (voice), Approve / Deny and **Stop**.
4. **Up next**: the next events from the summary, with "Now" / "in 25m", place or video call.
5. **Quick**: **Block 30m** (a Focus block from now), **Journal note** (your own words, by voice), **New task** (a
   T3 task by voice, the words checked before they go), and which Mac, which route (direct or via iPhone) and how
   fresh, with a refresh.

**The conversation** (CONTRACTS-WAVE5/5b; the rules are `ConversationMachine` in SamRabbitKit, unit-tested; the
watch app's `ConversationEngine` carries them out):

- **Always on.** The app opens straight into a conversation: launched, back from the background, the Action Button,
  Siri ("Ask SamRabbit", "Talk to SamRabbit") and the complications (`samrabbit://talk`). It warms the Mac up at
  once (`POST /assistant/session`), listens, and after each reply listens again by itself. Wrist down keeps it going
  (`UIBackgroundModes: audio`); the wrist coming back up continues it; the Digital Crown lets the reply finish and
  pauses (back within three minutes: the same conversation; back while the reply still plays: it just goes on). It
  ends on Stop, when the Mac says so (`endConversation`), or about two minutes after the last turn that heard words
  (noise, coughs and empty transcripts never keep it open, even in a room so noisy it never looks "listening"), and
  tells the Mac (`/assistant/end`).
- **One audio graph per conversation** (`AudioGraph`): `AVAudioSession` play-and-record (AirPods allowed), one
  `AVAudioEngine` started in front and kept running between turns (watchOS can't start recording from the
  background): the input's tap converted to 16 kHz mono 16-bit, and an `AVAudioPlayerNode` for replies.
- **Speech detection** (`SpeechDetector`): energy 10 dB over the room's noise floor (and over -50 dBFS) for 150 ms
  starts speech; 1 s of quiet ends it; at least 0.18 s from the start of speech to its last loud moment (a short
  "yes" or "ok" confirms approvals and gets through; a click doesn't); cut at 30 s; 300 ms before speech kept. The noise
  floor ignores digital silence (readings at or below -100 dBFS) and never goes below -80 dBFS (`NoiseFloor`, also
  in the voice capture's `VoiceActivity`). Half duplex: the microphone is ignored while a turn is on its way and while
  anything plays, and the reply's echo (300 ms) is skipped.
- **Turns stream** (`BridgeClient.assistantTurn`): the utterance goes up as a 16 kHz WAV with
  `X-SamRabbit-Conversation`, `X-SamRabbit-Turn` (a uuid: a retry gets the same answer) and
  `X-SamRabbit-Device-Time`, `Accept: application/x-samrabbit-stream`; the answer's frames (`AssistantStreamParser`)
  are played as they arrive, after a 0.2 s jitter buffer (`PlaybackJitterBuffer`: the realtime voice arrives at the
  pace it is spoken; it starts at 0.2 s buffered, 0.35 s after the first frame, or at the end of the stream, and
  buffers again if it runs dry), and `say.delta` is the live caption. The stream may stay quiet for 90 s (a long tool
  call; the bridge's `{"type":"ping"}` keep-alives are skipped), but the bridge must answer within 50 s (so a Mac out
  of reach falls back to the iPhone quickly). An older bridge or the Claude fallback answers in one piece
  (`AssistantReply`): a 16 kHz WAV plays the same way, an MP3/AAC clip is decoded and played. "Still answering" (409)
  is retried for a few seconds, through the iPhone too (the phone runs a refused turn again with the recording it
  kept; the watch doesn't send it twice). An `error` event in the stream follows the same rules as a refusal:
  `assistant_unavailable` or a revoked watch is said and ends the conversation (a revoked watch shows Reconnect at
  once); `assistant_interrupted` says "I got cut off" (tools may have acted: never "try again"); a conversation the
  Mac forgot starts a new one.
- **Playback never hangs on "Speaking"**: an audio route change (AirPods coming or going) reports what was playing as
  played out, scheduled audio that is long overdue is dropped (`AudioGraph.checkStalled`), and a finished reply that
  never reports its end is over after a minute.
- **Barge-in**: a tap while it thinks or speaks stops playback, drops the stream and `POST /assistant/cancel`s; it
  listens at once.
- **The watch's own voice**: a reply without audio is said with `AVSpeechSynthesizer` (the best en-US voice, written
  into the same player). A Mac out of reach (neither directly nor through the iPhone) is said out loud: "I can't
  reach your Mac right now", with a failure haptic, then the conversation ends ("Can't reach your Mac" under the orb).
- **Announcements**: while a conversation is open the watch polls `/assistant/announcements` about every 20 s and plays
  them between turns: their own clip if they carry one (one the watch can't read is said in its own voice), else as a
  `{"announce": id}` turn in the conversation's voice (if that fails, the watch says the line itself). The bridge
  counts one as told once the watch has it, so none is dropped: one queued while someone spoke plays once it listens
  again; one waiting at the quiet end is said instead of ending; one waiting when the conversation ends (Stop, a
  fatal failure, a late poll) is said first in the next one; the Mac's goodbye waits until they were said.
- **Through the iPhone** (`TurnRelay`): when the Mac can't be reached directly the utterance goes to the phone in
  `VoiceRelay` chunks (purpose `turn`), the phone sends the turn with the watch's own child token and the watch pulls
  the answer back in pieces of at most 40 KB as it streams in (`TurnRelayHost` on the phone). A stream, a buffered
  answer and an error envelope come through unchanged. The phone holds a background-task assertion
  (`RelayAwake`) around every request it passes on, and for a turn from its start until the watch has the last piece.
- **Haptics**: start (listening), click (sent, the thinking tick), notification (an announcement), failure, stop.
- Nothing heard or said, and no audio, is ever logged; the logs say only which phase it moved to.

**Voice only, never a keyboard.** watchOS has no speech recognizer, and the system text input offers the keyboard
and Scribble, so the watch never opens it (no `TextFieldLink`, no `presentTextInputController`, no text fields).
Every place that takes text (Ask, Reply, Answer, Journal note, and the Action Button / Siri route into Ask) opens
`VoiceCaptureView` (`watchOS/App/Voice/`), full screen:

- It listens at once: `AVAudioRecorder`, AAC `.m4a`, 16 kHz mono at about 32 kbps, metering on, the `.record`
  audio session, after `AVAudioApplication.requestRecordPermission()`. The orb swells and stirs with the input level;
  a big **Stop**. It stops by itself about 1.5 s after you stop speaking (`VoiceActivity`: the noise floor follows
  the room, speech is 10 dB above it for 150 ms), at 60 s at the latest; a clip under 0.4 s is discarded
  ("Didn't catch that").
- "Writing it down…": the file goes to `POST /v1/mobile/transcribe?lang=<watch locale>` with the watch's own token
  (`BridgeClient.transcribe(file:)`, `URLSession.upload(fromFile:)`). If the Mac can't be reached (or doesn't answer
  in time: transcribing changes nothing, so it is safe to resend), it goes through the iPhone: WatchConnectivity
  `sendMessage` with raw `Data` chunks of at most 40 KB (`VoiceRelay`: `id`, `seq`, `of`, each acknowledged); the
  iPhone puts it back together (`VoiceRelay.Assembler`) and uploads it with the watch's child token
  (`BridgeAccount.performRelayedTranscription`, the same rules as `performRelayed`), answering the last chunk with
  the bridge's status and body. Recordings are deleted right after (and leftovers at launch).
- The words, large, with **Send** and **Say again** (close the sheet to cancel). Send performs the original action
  (a new task, the reply, the answer with the card's `requestId`, the journal note) and closes; if it fails the words
  stay with what went wrong.
- When the Mac can't transcribe (`summary.transcribe.available == false`, or the bridge's
  `transcribe_unavailable` / `transcribe_permission` / `transcribe_failed` / `no_speech` / `audio_too_long` /
  `body_too_large` / `unsupported_audio` / ...), a friendly line says why (`VoiceProblem`), with **Say again**. A
  refused microphone says where to allow it. An older bridge without the route says to update it.

A result line slides in after every action; failures say why ("Mac and iPhone are out of reach").

**Pairing and networking.** The watch never pairs on its own. The iPhone issues the watch its own child token
(`POST /v1/mobile/devices/child`, revocable from the Mac) and sends it with the bridge addresses in
`applicationContext` (`WatchContext`); a watch without a pairing asks for it with `sendMessage`
(`WatchContext.requestKey`). The watch stores it like the phone does (App Group + Keychain), so the complications use
it too. Every request goes to the bridge directly (`URLSession`, 6 s). The watch's `BridgeClient` has the iPhone as
its `BridgeRelay` (`watchOS/App/PhoneLink.swift`): a request that reached no address goes to the phone with
`sendMessage` (`WatchRelay`), the phone performs it with the watch's own child token (which it keeps in its Keychain;
never the phone's token) and answers with the bridge's status and body, so a watch revoked on the Mac is refused
through the phone too. Only the watch's own kinds of request are relayed (summary, tasks, calendar, journal,
conversations, generated UIs, Mac); pairing, `unpair` and device management never are.
After a direct failure the watch prefers the phone for two minutes. A POST that may have reached the Mac (it timed
out) is never sent again another way. If the Mac revokes the watch, the status page offers **Reconnect**, which asks
the phone for a new child token (`WatchContext.reissueValue`). Re-pairing the iPhone reissues the watch's token too.
A new child token replaces the old one: the bridge drops this phone's earlier watch of the same name, and the phone
revokes a still older watch token (from before it re-paired) with `POST /v1/mobile/unpair`.

**Complications** (`SamRabbitWatchWidgets`, WidgetKit accessory families): **Needs You**: circular (the count in a
ring of everything open), corner (the count, with the next event along the bezel), inline ("2 need you · 2 working",
shorter when the slot is small); **Next Up**: rectangular (next event, time and "in 20m", working and needs-you
counts). The timeline reads the summary the watch app saved and fetches a fresh one itself, with an entry every 5
minutes for an hour (so "in 20m" stays right) and a refresh every 15 minutes; the watch app reloads them only when
the summary it fetched (every 30 s) says something new (`SummaryCache.publish`).
Tapping opens the matching page (`samrabbit://tab/needs`, `samrabbit://tab/upnext`).

**Debug launch arguments**: `-SamRabbitPage <status|needs|working|upnext|quick>`, `-SamRabbitRoute phone` (everything
through the iPhone), `-SamRabbitIntent <ask|needs|working|upnext|quick>` (runs the Action Button's intent at launch),
`-SamRabbitRenderComplications YES` (renders the complication faces into Documents/renders),
`-SamRabbitConversation off` (no conversation by itself), `-SamRabbitIdleSeconds <n>` (end after n quiet seconds
instead of two minutes), `-SamRabbitStillOrb YES` (UI tests: no orb animation), `-SamRabbitAudioOut on|mute` (the
simulator is muted unless `on`). Debug builds only (not compiled into Release): `-SamRabbitVoiceFixture
speech|hold|quiet` replaces the microphone with a made-up voice for the simulator and the UI tests (the voice capture:
`VoiceFixtureSource`, real levels and a real AAC file; the conversation: `ConversationFixture`, which speaks
`-SamRabbitFixtureTurns n` times, `-SamRabbitFixtureLead s` seconds after the microphone opens;
`-SamRabbitFixtureMicDelay s` allows the microphone only after s seconds, like the first launch's prompt or Siri still
holding it), and `-SamRabbitVoicePermission denied` acts as if the microphone was refused. The simulator never listens through the
Mac's own microphone: without a fixture the conversation hears silence there.

**Kit additions for the watch**: `BridgeRelay` and `BridgeClient(relay:)`, `BridgeAccount(relay:)`,
`WatchContext.requestKey`/`reissueValue`, `OrbView(frameRate:level:)`; for voice `Transcript`, `TranscribeStatus`
(`MobileSummary.transcribe`), `VoiceFormat`, `VoiceActivity`, `VoiceProblem`, `VoiceRelay`,
`BridgeClient.transcribe(file:|audio:)`, `BridgeRelay.relayTranscription`. The iPhone side (`iOS/App/WatchLink.swift`) answers
context requests and relays with the watch's token; the logic is in the Kit (`BridgeAccount.provisionWatch`,
`performRelayed`) so `swift test` covers it.
