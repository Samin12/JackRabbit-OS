# Using SamRabbit

This guide begins with a SamRabbit R1 that is already running. It covers the device UI and the management console that the R1 serves to a browser on the same local network.

SamRabbit is under active development. When a capability has incomplete physical acceptance, the guide says so directly.

## Device controls

SamRabbit is the R1 HOME surface. Voice is the first page and Cards is the second.

- Use the touch screen for buttons, tabs, lists, and sliders.
- Use the scroll wheel for supported list navigation.
- Use the side button (the R1's only button):
  - **Double-press** to start talking, from any page and even with the screen off. Double-press again to end the conversation, even while SamRabbit is speaking.
  - **Press once** to turn the screen off or on. The screen turns off about 0.3 seconds after you let go, because the R1 first waits to see whether a second press follows. Turning the screen off ends a live conversation.
  - **Hold** for the power menu.
  - Both presses of a double press must start within 0.3 seconds of each other. A slower double press counts as two single presses.
  - The double press comes from the SamRabbit power-button overlay (`android/system/power-overlay`, installed to `/oem/overlay`). Without it, a double press does nothing special.
- SamRabbit keeps the screen awake while its activity is visible.

Open the gear icon at the upper right for Settings. The running-person icon at the top opens the native Background Agent run surface.

## Connect Wi-Fi and open Management

1. On the R1, open **Settings → Wi-Fi**.
2. Select the network and enter its credentials when prompted.
3. Confirm that the R1 and the browser device are on the same local network.
4. Open **Settings → Management**.
5. Note the HTTPS address displayed by the R1.
6. Read the displayed pairing code. It is a one-time six-digit code and expires after five minutes; use **Refresh** if a new code is needed.
7. Enter the displayed address in the browser.
8. Follow the browser or operating system's certificate-trust flow. The management page provides the R1's local certificate for download when needed.
9. Enter the pairing code in the browser.

A paired browser session lasts 30 minutes. If authorization expires, use **Refresh** on the R1 and pair again with the newly displayed code.

The address is local to the active Wi-Fi or Ethernet network. A cellular address is not advertised as the management address.

## Add your name before using Voice

Do this immediately after pairing the management console and before configuring
or using ChatGPT, Platform access, or Voice:

1. Open **Overview** in the management console.
2. Find the **Your Profile** card titled **How R1 addresses you**.
3. Enter the name you want SamRabbit to use in **Your name**.
4. Choose **Save name**.
5. Do not continue until the card reports **Name saved.**

Do not skip this setup step. SamRabbit reads this saved profile when creating
the personalized greeting for a new Voice connection. If no name is saved, the
personalized connection greeting is omitted. The name can be changed later from
the same **Overview → Your Profile** card.

## Connect OpenAI access

Before continuing, confirm **Overview → Your Profile** reports **Name saved.**
If OpenAI access was connected first, return to Overview and save the name
before starting Voice.

Open **AI & Voice** in the management console.

### ChatGPT/Codex subscription access

1. Choose the ChatGPT/Codex connection action.
2. Follow the device-code authorization instructions shown by the management page.
3. Complete authorization in the OpenAI page opened by your browser.
4. Return to SamRabbit and wait for the connection state to report connected.

The authorization attempt is time-limited. SamRabbit exchanges and refreshes the resulting subscription credentials through its trusted runtime boundary. Disconnecting removes the saved authorization.

### OpenAI Platform access

1. Enter an owner-supplied OpenAI Platform API key in the Platform field.
2. Save the setting.
3. Wait for the runtime to refresh the model list reported by the provider.

The API key is sealed by the Android credential owner and is not stored as plaintext in the Python database.

### Choose models and reasoning

After connecting an access method:

1. Select the access path SamRabbit should use.
2. Select a text model.
3. Select a Realtime model.
4. Select the reasoning effort.
5. Save the settings and confirm the page reflects the selection.

Subscription choices come from SamRabbit's current catalog. Platform choices are filtered from the account's reported model list. Availability in either selector is not a guarantee that the model has completed physical R1 acceptance.

## Start and stop Voice

1. Return to the native **Voice** page.
2. Press the central microphone control.
3. Watch the state label:
   - `connecting` means the WebRTC session is being established.
   - `live` means the session can receive speech.
   - `responding` means the assistant is producing its response.
   - `error` means the session did not continue; the page should display a truthful failure state.
4. Speak normally while the session is live.
5. Press the active Voice control to end the session.

The native Android path owns microphone and speaker media. Python and MCP carry agent state and tool calls, not the high-rate audio stream.

If Voice cannot connect, verify the selected access method, model availability, network connectivity, and provider authorization in **AI & Voice**.

## Use Cards

Open the **Cards** tab from the native navigation. The deck contains:

- Calendar, which opens the upcoming-event view.
- Tasks, which opens local tasks.
- Any enabled static Creations.

Select a Card to open it. Use the page's back behavior to return to the deck, and choose Voice to return to the first page.

## Connect Calendar

Open **Connections → Calendar** in Management.

1. Add a connection and choose the available type appropriate to the source: ICS file, ICS subscription, or CalDAV.
2. Enter the label, endpoint or source details, and credentials requested by the form.
3. Save and wait for the connection status to report the synchronization result.
4. Open **Cards → Calendar** on the R1 to view upcoming events.

SamRabbit accepts up to two Calendar accounts and schedules synchronization every five minutes. The source's discovered capabilities determine whether create, update, or delete tools are available. Read-only sources reject mutations.

A Google Calendar secret iCal address is read-only, but when the Mac bridge is connected and the Mac has the signed-in Composio CLI with Google Calendar linked, Voice can add, move, and cancel events in that Google calendar through the Mac (see `companion/mac-bridge/README.md`, "Google Calendar changes"). New and moved events show on the R1 at once; cancelling an event always asks for a yes first.

The supplied R1 screenshot proves a real upcoming event can reach the native Calendar view. Not every Calendar provider and mutation path has completed physical acceptance.

## Connect Mail

Open **Connections → Mail** in Management.

1. Add an account.
2. Enter the IMAP and SMTP details requested by the form.
3. Save the account and wait for validation and synchronization status.

SamRabbit accepts up to three Mail accounts and schedules synchronization every five minutes. It can read locally synchronized messages, change read/unread state, prepare drafts, and send through SMTP. A sent message is also appended to the provider's Sent folder when supported.

Sending requires explicit confirmation. The approval is single-use and is bound to the exact draft content and the approving user utterance. Changing the draft invalidates the earlier approval. No model-facing Mail delete, trash, expunge, or purge operation exists.

The management API returns account configuration and status, not message content. Provider-specific physical acceptance is still partial.

## Use Tasks

Open **Cards → Tasks** to view local tasks. Voice can create, list, update, complete, and remove task records through the shared tool boundary.

Tasks currently store a title and completion state. They do not provide due dates, schedules, reminders, or notifications.

## Manage the Library

Open **Library** in Management. Its tabs separate Skills, Plugins, MCP, Tools, and Creations.

### Skills

The current Skills tab imports one exact `SKILLS.MD` instruction document for
Voice and one for Background Agent. Choose the destination, review it, and
confirm replacement when that destination already has a document. This
owner-managed instruction document is distinct from a standard Agent Skill:
standard Skills use `SKILL.md` and are currently loaded through Agent Plugin
packages.

### Plugins

Plugin packages declare their identity and components in `plugin.json` and can include Skills, MCP connections, and Cards. SamRabbit preflights imports before confirmation, records component ownership, and supports enable, disable, replacement, and removal.

Known limitation: replacing a Plugin that previously supplied a Card with one
that supplies no Card can leave the old Card registered in a disabled state.
Deleting the Plugin removes its owned Card normally.

### MCP and Tools

MCP connections define external model-facing tool sources. After adding a connection, run discovery, inspect the tools, and enable only the connection and audiences you intend to expose. Effective access is the intersection of the declared permission and the selected Voice or Background Agent audience.

The Tools tab shows built-in and discovered tools and their current audience.

### Creations

Creations are bounded static ZIP packages containing an `index.html`. After a Creation passes inspection and is enabled, it appears in the native Cards deck and renders inside a confined WebView.

The native Settings page also exposes Creation import. QR descriptors can identify Creation sources; linked sources must use public HTTPS URLs. Imports reject unsafe paths, symbolic links, encrypted entries, and archives outside the configured size and compression limits.

To build a Skill, Plugin, MCP integration, built-in Tool, standalone Creation,
or Plugin-owned Card, read the [Extension Development Guide](EXTENSION-DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Use Background Agent

Background Agent is implemented development functionality whose latest corrections still need a recorded successful physical delegated run.

### Configure it

1. Open **Background Agent** in Management.
2. Enable or disable execution.
3. Choose the available model, reasoning effort, tools, and bounded run limits.
4. Save the settings.

The defaults are 300 seconds, 24 model turns, 40 tool calls, two review rounds, and an 8 MiB workspace.

### Start or inspect a run

Voice can delegate a goal through the Background Agent goal tool. On the R1, use the running-person icon to open the native run surface. In Management, use **Run Logs** for lifecycle and delivery status and **Reasoning Logs** for provider-returned summaries and bounded tool metadata.

Possible states include queued, running, reviewing, repairing, completed, failed, and cancelled. A failure is retained as a failure rather than being presented as completed work. Terminal runs can be removed from Management.

Reasoning Logs do not contain hidden chain-of-thought, tool arguments, or tool results.

## Native Settings reference

- **Wi-Fi:** Scan and connect to wireless networks.
- **Bluetooth:** Change the Bluetooth enabled state.
- **Theme:** Pick how the assistant looks: the blue **Orb** or the voxel **Pixel head**. Both tiles show a live preview; tap one to apply it everywhere at once (Voice, Control Center, About and the other places the orb appears). The row shows the current choice.
- **Management:** View the local address and pairing code, and refresh management status.
- **AI:** View or change provider access, models, and reasoning; enter a Platform key.
- **Creations:** Open native Creation import.
- **Sound:** Adjust the device media volume.
- **Display:** Adjust screen brightness. The wheel navigates; use touch to change the slider. The Theme line under it opens the Theme page.
- **About:** View runtime information and request a runtime restart.

## Troubleshooting

### The management page does not open

- Confirm the browser and R1 are on the same local network.
- Reopen **Settings → Management** and use the currently displayed HTTPS address.
- Confirm the browser trusts the certificate presented by this R1.
- Do not substitute a cellular address; SamRabbit advertises the active local Wi-Fi or Ethernet address.

### Pairing fails or expires

- Use **Refresh** on the R1 to display a new code. Codes are one-time and expire after five minutes.
- Enter the new code in the same HTTPS origin shown by the device.
- If a previously paired page has been idle, pair again; browser sessions expire after 30 minutes.

### Voice remains in `connecting` or enters `error`

- Check network connectivity.
- In **AI & Voice**, confirm the selected access method is connected and the selected Realtime model is still available.
- Reauthorize ChatGPT/Codex if its connection has expired, or resave a valid Platform key.
- Open **Settings → About** and restart the runtime if its status is not ready.

### Calendar or Mail does not refresh

- Open **Connections** and inspect the account's last synchronization state and detail.
- Verify the endpoint, credentials, TLS mode, and provider availability.
- Allow for the five-minute synchronization cadence.
- For Calendar mutations, confirm the source reports the required capability.

### An extension is unavailable

- Confirm that the package passed preflight and confirmation.
- Confirm the Skill, Plugin, MCP connection, or Creation is enabled.
- For MCP tools, confirm discovery succeeded and the intended agent audience is allowed.
- Review import recovery or quarantine state if an earlier lifecycle action was interrupted.

### An installed Creation does not open

Known issue: the current CipherOS-derived SamRabbit image can have the AOSP
WebView package installed and enabled while Android has selected no current
WebView provider. The Creation may be installed correctly even though tapping
its Card cannot open it.

Connect the booted R1 to a computer with ADB access and run:

```bash
adb shell cmd webviewupdate set-webview-implementation com.android.webview
adb shell dumpsys webviewupdate
```

If `adb` is not on `PATH`, substitute the path to the Android SDK
`platform-tools/adb` executable. The first command must report `Success`. The
verification output must report all of the following before opening the
Creation again:

```text
Current WebView package ... com.android.webview
Any WebView package installed: true
Number of relros started: <non-zero count>
Number of relros finished: <the same count>
```

The confirmed R1 reached `1` started and `1` finished.

This changes Android's selected provider only. It does not erase data, reflash
the R1, reinstall SamRabbit, or reinstall the Creation. If the verification
still reports `Current WebView package is null`, preserve the complete output
and report it rather than changing partitions manually.

Confirmed physical-device symptom:
`MissingWebViewPackageException: Failed to load WebView provider: No WebView installed`.
The runtime catalog and audit records can still show the affected Creation as
installed and enabled.

The permanent correction belongs in the CipherOS-derived Android image's
WebView provider policy, not in the SamRabbit APK. The current image retains
`/product/app/webview/webview.apk` as `com.android.webview`, but Android's
WebView update service can still start with no provider selected. Because the
current image is assembled from binary partition images and no
`config_webview_packages.xml` was found in the mounted system, product,
system_ext, or vendor partitions, an exact source-file correction has not been
verified. Do not add an APK workaround or claim an unverified file location.
Until the image policy is corrected and first-boot tested, the ADB command
above is the documented resolution for an already-installed device.

## Privacy reminders

- Voice and agent requests send the data needed for the request to the selected OpenAI access path.
- Connected Mail and Calendar sources exchange data with their configured servers.
- Web search and outbound MCP tools send relevant request data to those services.
- Treat imported packages and external MCP servers as third-party components and review their declared access before enabling them.
- Management is local-network scoped, but it still exposes owner controls; pair only browsers you trust.
